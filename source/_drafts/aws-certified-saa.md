Operational Excellence
    - Perform operations as code
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operations procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational failures
Security
    - Implement a strong identity foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - Prepare for security events
Reliability
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation
Performance Efficiency
    - Democratize advanced technologies
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy
        Mechanical sympathy is when you use a tool or system with an understanding of how it operates best.
        > You don't have to be an engineer to be be a racing driver, but you do have to have Mechanical Sympathy. Jackie Stewart, racing driver
        When you understand how a system is designed to be used, you can align with the design to gain optimal performance. For example, if you know that a certain type of memory is more efficient when addresses are multiples of a factor, you can optimize your performance by using data structure alignment.
Cost Optimization
    - Implement Cloud Financial Management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure
